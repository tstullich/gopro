GoPro (Go Programs)
=====
A small repository that I created in order to have some nice flexible data structures and the likes in order
to make my future development a bit easier, as I won't have to start from scratch every time. Feel free to
clone this repository and use my code as you wish, but it will be at your own risk. I won't take any responsibility
if your code misbehaves.

To Use
=====
* Simply clone this repository anywhere you like, then copy as many root folders as you need into your source 
folder (usually in your __src__ folder in your Go workbench).
* Then include the directory path in your .go files (i.e. "ds/queue").

All data structures should be self-contained so there should not be any dependency issues if you only include 
one or two files.
