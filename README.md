GoPro (Go Programs)
=====
A small repository that I created in order to have some nice flexible data structures and the likes in order
to make my future development a bit easier, as I won't have to start from scratch every time. Feel free to
clone this repository and use my code as you wish, but it will be at your own risk. I won't take any responsibility
if your code misbehaves.
